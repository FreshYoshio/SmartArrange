# SmartArrange

**SmartArrange** is a simple file organization tool built with Python. It helps you sort your messy folders by automatically grouping files by type into categorized folders — with just a single click!

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I was struggling with a messy desktop and unorganized folders. Manually going through each file was time-consuming, so I decided to create this tool. Now, organizing my files is faster and much easier.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically detects and organizes files by type:
  - PDFs
  - Images
  - Documents
  - Audio & video
  - And more!
- Clean and user-friendly graphical interface (GUI)
- Built entirely with Python and Tkinter
- Includes custom application icon

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter
- PyInstaller

## 📦 How to Use

1. Launch the application.
2. Select the folder you want to organize.
3. Click "Start Organizing".
4. That’s it! Your files will be sorted into subfolders automatically.

## 💡 Future Plans

- Automatic backup before organizing
- Scheduled cleanup tasks
- Support for more file types
